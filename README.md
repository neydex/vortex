# Vortex
Vortex is a simple python-based terminal program used to encode or decode with base85, base64, base32 and base16.

Its just one file and you can look at the src in *main.py*.

You can find the working .exe <a href="https://github.com/neydex/vortex/releases/">here</a>

Updates coming soon (maybe).
